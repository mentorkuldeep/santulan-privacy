    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <h2 id="s1">1. Our Commitment to You</h2>
    <p>Santulan exists to support the emotional wellbeing of students, parents, and teachers across India. We understand that using our platform — especially Sathi, our AI crisis companion — requires trust. This privacy policy explains exactly what data we collect, why, and how we protect it.</p>
    <div class="safe">
        <strong>Our core privacy principles:</strong><br>
        • We collect the minimum data needed to provide support.<br>
        • Crisis conversation content is encrypted and never used for AI training.<br>
        • Teacher data is never shared with school administration.<br>
        • Student data is handled with extra protection under the DPDP Act.<br>
        • You can delete your data at any time.
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <h2 id="s2">2. Who This Policy Applies To</h2>
    <p>This policy applies to all users of the Santulan platform, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Students</strong> aged 10-18 using Santulan through their school or independently</li>
        <li><strong>Parents</strong> and guardians using the parent pathway</li>
        <li><strong>Teachers</strong> and school staff using the teacher pathway</li>
        <li><strong>School administrators</strong> who access aggregate (non-individual) reports</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are under 18, your parent or guardian must provide verifiable consent for your use of the platform, as required under Section 9 of the DPDP Act, 2023.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <h2 id="s3">3. What Data We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>3.1 Account Information</h3>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Data</th><th>Why We Collect It</th><th>Required?</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Name</td><td>To personalise your experience</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Age / Date of Birth</td><td>To provide age-appropriate content and comply with DPDP Act child provisions</td><td>Yes</td></tr>

        <tr><th>Data</th><th>Why We Collect It</th><th>Who Sees It</th></tr>
        <tr><td>SELI/PELI/TELI assessment responses</td><td>To provide personalised wellbeing insights and identify when support is needed</td><td>You. Anonymised aggregate data may be visible to school administrators. Individual responses are never shared.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Pulse check-in responses</td><td>To track your wellbeing over time and detect declining patterns</td><td>You only.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Assessment scores and domain results</td><td>To personalise your learning modules and tools</td><td>You. Aggregate school-level data (no individual identification) for administrators.</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h3>3.3 Sathi Conversation Data</h3>
    <div class="critical">
        <strong>Crisis conversation data receives the highest level of protection on our platform.</strong> See Section 5 for complete details.
    </div>

    <h3>3.4 Usage Data</h3>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Data</th><th>Why</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Which modules and tools you access</td><td>To improve content recommendations</td></tr>

    </table>

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <h2 id="s4">4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use your data for the following purposes only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Providing the service:</strong> Assessments, personalised content, Sathi crisis support, helpline connections</li>
        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Detecting crisis states, triggering escalation protocols, connecting to human support when needed</li>
        <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> Analysing anonymised, aggregated data to improve content and therapeutic quality</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Follow-up Pulse check-ins, platform updates, and safety-critical notifications</li>
        <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> Meeting obligations under the DPDP Act, IT Act, and mandatory reporting requirements (e.g. POCSO)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>We NEVER use your data for:</strong><br>
        • Advertising or marketing to third parties<br>
        • Selling to any third party, for any reason, ever<br>
        • AI model training or fine-tuning (see Section 5)<br>
        • Profiling for purposes unrelated to your wellbeing<br>
        • Sharing individual data with school administrators (only anonymised aggregates)
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 5 -->
    <h2 id="s5">5. Sathi Crisis Conversations — Special Protections</h2>
    <p>When you talk to Sathi during a crisis, you are sharing some of the most personal and sensitive information possible. We treat this data with the highest standard of care.</p>

    <h3>5.1 What Happens During a Crisis Conversation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your conversation is processed by a large language model (LLM) via API to generate Sathi's responses in real time.</li>
        <li>Operational metadata is logged: date, time, escalation level, techniques used, helplines offered, session duration.</li>
        <li>Conversation content (what you actually said) is encrypted and stored in a separate, access-restricted crisis log.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.2 What Sathi Remembers Between Conversations</h3>
    <div class="safe">
        <strong>Sathi remembers:</strong> That a crisis occurred (date, level), which techniques worked or didn't, which helplines were shared, your language preference, your Step 6 micro-plan.<br><br>
        <strong>Sathi does NOT remember:</strong> The specific content of what you shared, your exact words, details of abuse disclosures, or detailed emotional content. This information exists only in the encrypted crisis log.
    </div>

    <h3>5.3 Crisis Data and AI Training</h3>
    <div class="critical">
        <strong>Your crisis conversations are NEVER used to train, fine-tune, or improve any AI model.</strong><br><br>
        This is a firm, non-negotiable policy. Under the DPDP Act 2023, using crisis conversation data for model training would require explicit separate consent — and asking someone in crisis for consent to use their data is ethically indefensible. We will never do this.<br><br>
        Sathi improves through <em>human clinical review</em> of anonymised conversation patterns, not through AI learning from your conversations.
    </div>

    <h3>5.4 Who Can Access Crisis Conversation Logs</h3>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Who</th><th>What They See</th><th>When</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Clinical Review Panel (licensed psychologists)</td><td>Full conversation content (encrypted, access-logged)</td><td>Level 3+: within 7 days. Level 4: within 48 hours. Level 5: within 24 hours.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Santulan Safety Team</td><td>Operational metadata only (not content)</td><td>Ongoing monitoring</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Law enforcement</td><td>As required by law (court order)</td><td>Only with valid legal process</td></tr>
        <tr><td>School administrators</td><td>NOTHING. Zero access to any individual crisis data.</td><td>Never.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Parents/guardians</td><td>Notification that their child accessed crisis support. NOT the content.</td><td>Level 3+ (unless alleged abuser — see 5.5)</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h3>5.5 Abuse Disclosure Protocol</h3>
    <p>If a student discloses abuse during a crisis conversation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The content is flagged for mandatory reporting review under POCSO Act 2012.</li>
        <li>If the alleged abuser is a parent or guardian, parental notification is <strong>immediately suspended</strong>.</li>
        <li>Childline 1098 is the primary referral. The human governance panel reviews within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Sathi never informs the alleged abuser.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- SECTION 6 -->
    <h2 id="s6">6. Data We Never Collect or Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Precise GPS location (we use city-level only, derived from IP or user-provided)</li>
        <li>Contact lists, photos, or files from your device</li>
        <li>Biometric data</li>
        <li>Financial information (Santulan is free for individual users)</li>
        <li>Social media data</li>
        <li>Browsing history outside the Santulan platform</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- SECTION 7 -->
    <h2 id="s7">7. Who Can Access Your Data</h2>

    <h3>7.1 Teacher Data — Absolute Confidentiality</h3>
    <div class="safe">
        <strong>Teacher assessment results (TELI), crisis conversations, and personal wellbeing data are NEVER shared with school administration, principals, management, or any school authority.</strong><br><br>
        This is non-negotiable. Teachers must feel completely safe to use Santulan without fear of professional consequences. School administrators only receive anonymised, aggregate wellbeing statistics (e.g., "62% of teachers report moderate-to-high wellbeing" — never individual data).
    </div>

    <h3>7.2 Student Data</h3>
    <p>Individual student assessment and crisis data is shared only with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The student themselves</li>
        <li>Parents/guardians (with limitations — see Section 5.4)</li>
        <li>The clinical review panel (for safety review)</li>
        <li>Designated school counselor (only if student consents and school-integrated)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7.3 Parent Data</h3>
    <p>Parent assessment and crisis data is visible only to the parent and the clinical review panel. It is never shared with their child, the school, or any third party.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 8 -->
    <h2 id="s8">8. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).</li>
        <li><strong>Crisis logs:</strong> Stored in a separate, access-restricted database with additional encryption. Access is logged and auditable.</li>
        <li><strong>Server location:</strong> All data is stored on servers located in India, compliant with DPDP Act data localisation requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Access controls:</strong> Role-based access. Clinical reviewers access crisis logs only through authenticated, audited channels. Engineers do not have access to decrypted conversation content.</li>
        <li><strong>LLM API processing:</strong> Crisis conversations are sent to the LLM provider (OpenAI/Anthropic) via API for real-time response generation. We use API configurations that ensure the provider does not retain or train on this data. See Section 12.</li>
        <li><strong>Breach notification:</strong> In the event of a data breach, affected users will be notified within 72 hours as required by the DPDP Act, and the Data Protection Board of India will be informed.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- SECTION 9 -->
    <h2 id="s9">9. Children's Privacy (Under 18)</h2>
    <p>Santulan serves students aged 10-18. Under Section 9 of the DPDP Act, 2023:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verifiable parental consent is required before a child can use the platform.</li>
        <li>We do not engage in tracking, behavioural monitoring, or targeted advertising directed at children.</li>
        <li>We do not process children's data in any way that could cause harm to their wellbeing.</li>
        <li>Assessment tools (SELI) are designed specifically for children's developmental contexts.</li>
        <li>Crisis conversation protections apply with additional safeguards (abuse disclosure protocol, parental notification with student agency).</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Student Agency in Notifications:</strong> When parental notification is required (Level 3+), the student is informed first and given choices about how their parents learn about the situation. This balances safety obligations with the child's dignity and agency. See our Crisis Practitioner Specification, Section 9.3.
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 10 -->
    <h2 id="s10">10. Your Rights Under DPDP Act 2023</h2>
    <p>As a Data Principal under the DPDP Act, you have the following rights:</p>

    <!-- SECTION 11 -->
    <h2 id="s11">11. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Data Type</th><th>Retention Period</th><th>After Retention</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Account information</td><td>Duration of account + 90 days</td><td>Permanently deleted</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Assessment responses</td><td>Duration of account + 90 days</td><td>Permanently deleted</td></tr>

    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. When we do:</p>
